SQLAlchemy-ImageAttach
======================

**SQLAlchemy-ImageAttach** is a SQLAlchemy_ extension for attaching images to
entity objects.  It provides the following features:

Storage backend interface
   You can use file system backend on your local development box,
   and switch it to AWS S3_ when it's deployed to the production box.
   Or you can add a new backend implementation by yourself.

Maintaining multiple image sizes
   Any size of thumbnails can be generated from the original size
   without assuming the fixed set of sizes.  You can generate a thumbnail
   of a particular size if it doesn't exist yet when the size is requested.
   Use RRS_ (Reduced Redundancy Storage) for reproducible thumbnails on S3.

Every image has its URL
   Attached images can be exposed as a URL.

SQLAlchemy transaction aware
   Saved file are removed when the ongoing transaction has been rolled back.

Tested on various environments
   - Python versions: Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, PyPy_
   - DBMS: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
   - SQLAlchemy: 0.8 or higher
